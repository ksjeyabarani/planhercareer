          <p class="lead">The importance of enhancing the role of women in an organization is realized widely across the world. A system that recommends personalised career growth plan, can motivate a working women to succeed and excel in her profession. This project is about building a Career Plan recommendation cloud based application that aid social support for women and provides predictive recommendation of career choices that can help an individual in gaining skills and opportunities that would strengthen her confidence and financial independence. The application will mine the data from social networking websites and map it to user’s profile based on education, expertise, experience, region and culture and forecast the likely future growth and suggests improvements that would influence her career growth. It enables women empowerment through social collaboration by providing a platform for building local communities through its portal for features such as volunteering, promoting a cause, organizing events, seeking help and information sharing. The application uses a classification and regression technique as a predictive model for determining the “Social Proximity” and maps observations about a user to arrive at an item of probable interest to user. The resulting model is used for decision making in recommendation engine of the application. The project considers NoSQL database in order to scale the data that application collects. The system would need to crawl data in unstructured format from more than one external source, parse it and record in data stores. The model built would need to be updated as new data comes in. The expected results from the project is to arrive at a model that makes predictive recommendations of items based on user profile and social relevance that could be easily applied, reused and extended for other scenarios of similar nature.</p>
