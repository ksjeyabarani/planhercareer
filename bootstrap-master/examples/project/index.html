              <p>The motivation of our project is in providing a tool that would enable an individual to achieve her career goals and creating a platform for free communication and mentoring. The impact of the solution improves lives and brings positive changes in community. It provides social support with similar users or groups.  Recommendation from social relationships is more effective compared to traditional approach of collaborative filtering. The user knows the people and can judge their preference better than a random person with similar interests. 
Studies have shown that friend-relationships provide similar ratings in taste related domains. Social recommendations are more transparent than traditional methods as the user will know why a certain recommendation was made.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Problem </h2>
          <p class="lead">The importance of enhancing the role of women in an organization is vital today. A career recommendation system which helps the women in their career path has more relevance in this social world.  It enables the women to visualize her career growth and set goals to achieve it and also to track her progress. To this end, there is a need for a system that would mentor her, based on the current trend and demand in the industry. Such a system needs to be trained with data that is relevant and useful for arriving at a solution. 
Internet is flooded with information every day. Easy access to large amount of information along with difficulty in judging the validity of so much content can lead to information overload. Deriving useful knowledge from the abundance of information scattered in the media is a huge task not normally possible to be done by an individual. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Needs</h2>
          <p class="lead">While women occupy nearly half of the jobs in most industries, usually only a very few percentage of them reach the top positions of any profession. 59% of women workers are making less than $8 an hour. There is a large gender based inequality in terms of wage, promotions, or eligibility in certain fields. Four in ten businesses worldwide have no women in senior management. In the corporate sector, women holding board seats only amount to 15% since 2002. 2003 census shows that women make only 77% of every dollar that men earn because women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. Women earn less than men in 99% of all occupations. Clearly, this situation can be improved by awareness, help and mentoring. Technology can be used to improve lives by finding a solution that combines social interaction with career planning and gives a direct access to mentoring and service.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Rationale</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The task of analysing data and providing recommendations based on the knowledge derived from data is best done on a large scale instead of doing repeatedly for every instance of need. Automated web data analysis is widely accepted as crucial and beneficial  in many different fields. 
Learning from the collective intelligence of the crowd has a huge potential in bringing benefits to every individual in terms of learning a pattern, finding a root cause, discovering attributes to success, recommending an item of probable interest, or extrapolating an event of high likelihood of occurrence. </p>
